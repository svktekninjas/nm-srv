## Common Failures and Issues

### SonarQube Analysis Failure
The most recent failure was related to SonarQube analysis:
```
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.sonarsource.scanner.maven:sonar-maven-plugin:3.9.1.2184:sonar (default-cli) on project naming_server_service: Could not find a default branch for project with key 'com.consultingfirm:naming_server_service'. Make sure project exists.
```

### Root Causes
1. **SonarQube Project Configuration**: The SonarQube project with key 'com.consultingfirm:naming_server_service' doesn't exist or is not properly configured in SonarCloud.
2. **Authentication Issue**: The SONAR_TOKEN secret might not have the correct permissions.
3. **Repository Structure Issue**: The Maven project structure might not match what SonarQube expects.

### Configuration Files
- **ci.yml**: Contains the workflow definition with build, test, SonarQube analysis, and Docker image building and pushing steps.
- **sonar-project.properties**: Contains SonarQube configuration with:
  - Project Key: svktekninjas_nm-srv
  - Organization: svktek
  - Source path: src/main/java
  - Binaries path: target/classes

## Recent Commit History
Most recent commits have been focused on fixing the CI/CD pipeline, particularly around SonarQube integration:
- Fixing ci.yml file for variables as per standards
- Fixing the variable file
- Fixing sonar scan issues
- Fixing the sonar variables
- Fixing Sonar secrets

## Recommendations
1. Verify SonarQube project existence and configuration
2. Check SonarQube authentication tokens and permissions
3. Ensure project structure matches SonarQube configuration
4. Update the sonar-project.properties file to match the Maven project structure
5. Consider implementing proper error handling in the workflow to provide more context for failures
