2. Created GitHub Actions workflow directory structure
3. Created CI workflow file (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
4. Created Dockerfile for Spring Boot application
5. Enhanced pom.xml with security and quality plugins
6. Created security configuration files (dependency-check-suppressions.xml, spotbugs filters)
7. Documented the entire process in git_branch_operations_guide.md
8. Added support for reading variables from .github/ENV/ci-variables.env file
9. Modified the CI workflow to use a dedicated job for loading environment variables
10. Created a comprehensive restructured guide (comprehensive_guide.md) with detailed sections on ECR image publishing and environment variable management
11. Created CI_implementation.md combining information from comprehensive_guide.md and git_branch_operations_guide.md with detailed project assessment, implementation components, environment configuration, security scanning setup, Amazon ECR integration, complete workflow implementation, and security best practices. This document provides both high-level architecture information and detailed code references with explanations.
